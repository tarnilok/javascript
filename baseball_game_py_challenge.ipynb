    "- **An integer x** - Record a new score of x,\r\n",
    "- **\"+\"** - Record a new score that is the sum of the previous scores. It is guaranteed there will always be two previous scores.\r\n",
    "- **\"D\"** - Record a new score that is double the previous score. It is guaranteed there will always be a previous score.\r\n",
